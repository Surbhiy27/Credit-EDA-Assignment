# Credit EDA Assignment





\## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This assignment focuses on applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a real-world business scenario. Along with practicing EDA techniques, it introduces concepts of \*\*risk analytics in banking and financial services. The objective is to understand how data can help minimise the risk of financial loss while lending money to customers.

\## ðŸ’¡ Business Understanding

Loan providers often struggle to approve loans for customers with little or no credit history. Some borrowers take advantage of this situation and default on loans.  



In this case, you are working for a consumer finance company that lends various types of loans to urban customers. Using EDA, you need to identify data patterns to ensure that creditworthy applicants are not rejected while reducing the chances of lending to potential defaulters.  



When evaluating a loan application, the company faces two types of risks:

1\. Loss of business if a good applicant is rejected.  

2\. Financial loss if a risky applicant (likely defaulter) is approved.

\## ðŸ“Š Scenarios in the Dataset

The dataset includes two main categories of clients:

\- Clients with payment difficulties â†’ late payments on at least one of the first instalments.  

\- Other clientsâ†’ applicants who paid on time.  



Possible decisions on a loan application:  

\- Approved â†’ Loan application accepted.  

\- Cancelled â†’ Application cancelled by the client (either voluntarily or due to unfavorable terms).  

\- Refused â†’ Loan rejected by the company (client didnâ€™t meet requirements).  

\- Unused Offer â†’ Loan was approved but not used by the client.  



The objective of this case study is to use EDA to analyze how \*\*consumer attributes\*\* and \*\*loan attributes\*\* influence loan default tendencies.

\## ðŸŽ¯ Business Objectives

The goal is to identify patterns that indicate potential loan defaults.  

This knowledge can be used for actions such as:  

\- Denying risky loan applications.  

\- Reducing the approved loan amount.  

\- Lending to risky applicants at higher interest rates.  



Ultimately, the aim is to ensure that reliable customers are not rejected while minimizing the companyâ€™s financial risk.

\## ðŸ“‚ Data Understanding

The dataset contains three files:  



1\. `application\_data.csv` â†’ Client information at the time of application.  

&nbsp;  - Indicates whether a client has had payment difficulties.  



2\. `previous\_application.csv` â†’ Information on clientsâ€™ previous loan applications.  

&nbsp;  - Records whether each application was \*Approved, Cancelled, Refused,\* or an \*Unused offer\*.  



3\. `columns\_description.csv` â†’ Data dictionary describing all variables.

\## ðŸ“˜ Notes

\- This case study requires applying EDA techniques to identify driver variables behind loan default.  

\- The insights generated can be used for portfolio management and risk assessment.  

\- Students are encouraged to research risk analytics to understand the significance of different variable types.
